# Wolt Search Optimization
This repository contains an analysis and improvement proposal for Wolt's in-app search functionality, developed as part of a product management assignment. The focus is on enhancing the search experience to improve user satisfaction and drive conversions. 

## Project Overview  
Wolt's in-app search feature plays a vital role in connecting users to restaurants, grocery stores, and services. By analyzing user behavior and performance metrics, I identified areas for improvement and proposed actionable solutions to optimize the search experience.  

### Key Deliverables  
1. **Making Wolt's tag system more dynamic and relevant to users**  
   - Dynamic Tags: Update tags based on user behavior, location, and time of day to improve relevance.
   - Category-Based Tags: Group tags into categories (e.g., Popular Searches, Restaurants, Shops, Cuisine Types) to catch usersâ€™ attention and guide choices. 

2. **Improving Wolt's Search Functionality: Enhancing Error Recognition**  
   - Enhanced Search Algorithm: Use machine learning to correct typos in real-time for relevant results.
   - Semantic Search Capabilities: Implement context understanding to interpret user intent, even with misspellings.

3. **Item-Dominant Searches**  
   - Tailored Recommendations:  Provide personalized item suggestions based on user preferences and past searches.
   - Streamlined Navigation: Enhance the search interface for quicker access to specific products, particularly essential items like groceries.

## Tools Used  
- **Google Sheet**: For data organization and exploratory analysis.  
- **Python**: To process and analyze search data, generate insights, and visualize key findings. 
- **Google Slides**: For presenting findings, proposed improvements, and visualizations effectively. 

## Lessons Learned  
This project deepened my understanding of user behavior analysis, search optimization strategies, and the importance of data-driven decision-making in product management.
